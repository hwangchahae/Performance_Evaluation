    "raw_text": "**참고:** 프로젝트명은 회의 내용을 바탕으로 적절히 명명해야 합니다. 예: \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" 또는 \"EML 프로젝트\" 등\n\n**중요:** JSON 형식에 맞게 작성하고, 각 항목은 문자열로 작성해야 합니다. 반드시 JSON Schema를 준수해야 합니다.\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a project plan based on the meeting transcript provided. First, I need to parse the meeting notes to extract key points.\n\nLooking at the transcript, there are mentions of \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" and \"EML의 프로젝트\". Also, there's discussion about building a construction analyzer, using ontologies, and integrating systems. The team is considering using a standard ontology and working with someone named Johno who's involved in parsing and analysis. There's also mention of a system that needs to be integrated, possibly involving a Swiss AI center in Germany.\n\nThe project name should be something like \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" or \"EML 프로젝트\" as per the instructions. But since the meeting talks about both, maybe combining elements. However, the user says to base it on the content, so maybe \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" is more specific. Wait, the user example uses \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" as an example, but the actual meeting mentions both SmartKom and EML. However, the core idea seems to be about building a system for construction analysis, so maybe the project name should reflect that. Alternatively, the main project mentioned is SmartKom, so perhaps that's the name.\n\nProject purpose: The main goal is to develop a construction analysis system, integrating different components and using ontologies. The objectives would include creating a standardized ontology, developing a parser and analyzer, and integrating with existing systems. The execution plan would involve defining the ontology, developing the tools, testing, and integration. Expected effects would be improved analysis, system integration, and shared resources.\n\nNeed to make sure all the points from the meeting are covered. The meeting also mentions a system that's part of a larger system, and the need to use their own system instead of others. Also, there's a mention of a person named Johno who is key to the project. The execution plan should have steps like defining the ontology, developing the tools, testing, and integration. The expected effects would be the successful implementation of the system, sharing of resources, and enhanced functionality.\n\nNow, structuring all this into the required JSON format. Project name: \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" or \"EML 프로젝트\"? The meeting starts with \"SmartKom 프로젝트\" and \"EML의 프로젝트 중 하나인가요?\" So maybe the project is part of EML, but the main focus is on SmartKom. Alternatively, the project could be called \"Construction Analysis System Integration Project\" but the user example uses \"SmartKom 프로젝트\". Let me check the original meeting again. The speaker asks if it's part of SmartKom or EML. So the project might be either, but the main discussion is about SmartKom. Therefore, the project name is \"SmartKom 프로젝트\".\n\nProject purpose: Develop a system for construction analysis, integrating various components and using ontologies. Core objectives: create a standardized ontology, develop a parser and analyzer, integrate with existing systems. Core idea: Using ontologies and existing systems to build a comprehensive analysis tool. Execution plan: Define ontology, develop tools, test, integrate. Expected effects: Improved analysis, system integration, shared resources.\n\nNow, translating all this into the JSON structure as per the instructions.\n```json\n{\n    \"project_name\": \"SmartKom 프로젝트\",\n    \"project_purpose\": \"구성 요소를 통합하여 건설 분석 시스템을 개발하고, 기존 시스템과의 연계를 통해 효율적인 데이터 처리 및 분석을 달성하는 데 중점을 둔 프로젝트입니다.\",\n    \"project_period\": \"2023년 10월부터 2024년 3월까지\",\n    \"project_manager\": \"Johno\",\n    \"core_objectives\": [\n        \"표준화된 온톨로지를 정의하여 시스템 간의 통합을 용이하게 함\",\n        \"파서 및 분석기를 개발하여 건설 데이터의 자동 처리를 가능하게 함\",\n        \"기존 시스템과의 유기적 연계를 통해 데이터의 정확성과 신뢰성을 높임\"\n    ],\n    \"core_idea\": \"기존 시스템과의 통합을 통해 건설 분석의 정확성과 효율성을 높이는 시스템 구축\",\n    \"idea_description\": \"건설 분"
